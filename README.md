# Gōng-fu I/O Weekly ✼ Hack Sessions

Our sessions happen remotely currently, join us on our [Gōng-fu I/O ‹Creative Coders›](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/gōngfuIO) group on Meetup. Register for the Hack Session you'd like to participate and leave a comment on Meetup, requesting an invite to our Slack group. See you soon!

The [issues in this repository](https://github.com/gongfuio/sessions/issues?q=is%3Aissue) eventually contain a (rather sparse) log of the activities of the individual sessions.
